# Super-Store-Sales-Dashboard
Its a sales dashboard of a Superstore for the year 2019 and 2020

The data sheet is for 2 years that is 2019-20. I cleaned the data, by removing unwanted coloumns and removed the error coloumn of returns coloumn.
Once cleaning was done, I moved on to graphical representation. I tried to showcase all the data, that is the delivery details, the preference of the payments, region wise sales, product wise sale, segment wise sale, year wise sale in different graphs, so that we can check, how's the sale is going on.
